# Viscoelastic Fluids Demos

These interactive notebooks were developed by **Leif Rune Hellevik (NTNU, Faculty of Engineering)**  
to support teaching and exploration of **linear viscoelastic behavior** in materials such as polymers and biological tissues.  
They form part of a pedagogical module introducing students to **creep**, **stress relaxation**, and **modeling of time-dependent material response** using the classical **Maxwell** and **Kelvin–Voigt** models.

All notebooks are designed for use directly in **Google Colab** and **JupyterLab**, with interactive sliders for material parameters.  
They can be freely reused for teaching and learning purposes with appropriate attribution.

### Usage
1. Click a **Colab badge** above to open the notebook in your browser.  
2. Choose *Runtime → Run all* to initialize the interactive widgets.  
3. Use the sliders to explore how the material parameters affect:
   - **Creep** (strain response to constant stress)
   - **Stress relaxation** (stress decay under constant strain)

Each student runs an **independent Colab session** — no installation needed.
