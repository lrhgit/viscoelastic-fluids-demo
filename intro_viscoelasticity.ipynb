    "## üß© Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In these notebooks, we focus on a subclass of material models known as **viscoelastic models**.  \n",
    "Material models describe how **stresses** (forces) relate to **deformation** ‚Äî  \n",
    "for solids, this means strain, and for fluids, the *rate* of deformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term *viscoelastic* is used because such materials exhibit both  \n",
    "**solid-like (elastic)** and **fluid-like (viscous)** behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture this dual nature, we combine two fundamental mechanical elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü™ß Elastic spring\n",
    "Represents the **solid-like** response:\n",
    "- Stress and deformation (strain) are related by the **elastic modulus** $E$.  \n",
    "- The magnitude of $E$ characterizes stiffness:  \n",
    "  - **High** $\\mathbf{E}$ ‚Üí stiff material  \n",
    "  - **Low** $\\mathbf{E}$ ‚Üí soft material  \n",
    "- No explicit time dependence ‚Äî deformation occurs *instantaneously* when stress is applied.  \n",
    "- Typically used to model **ideal solids**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üíß Dashpot\n",
    "Represents the **fluid-like** response:\n",
    "- Stress and *strain-rate* are related by the **viscosity** $\\eta$.  \n",
    "- Explicitly time-dependent: stress depends on how fast deformation occurs.  \n",
    "- The magnitude of $\\eta$ characterizes flow resistance:  \n",
    "  - **High** $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$ ‚Üí very viscous (thick) fluid  \n",
    "  - **Low** $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$ ‚Üí less viscous (runny) fluid  \n",
    "- Typically used to model **ideal fluids**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining springs and dashpots, we obtain the **viscoelastic models** studied here ‚Äî  \n",
    "the **Maxwell** and **Kelvin‚ÄìVoigt** models ‚Äî which represent two simple yet powerful ways of linking  \n",
    "elastic and viscous behavior.\n",
